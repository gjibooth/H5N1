# H5N1
 Figure-generating code for the XX article, "Fast-acting intranasal prophylaxis as an immediate response to respiratory virus pandemics prior to vaccine availability" by Booth, G et al.

## Reproducing figures
Each figure is produced by individual Jupyter Notebooks:

* [Figure 1](figure1_infections_vs_time.ipynb): Total and cumulative number of infections over time for unprotected, vaccinated, and intranasal prophylactic groups
* [Figure 2](figure2_coverage_vs_efficacy.ipynb): Intervention coverage vs efficacy on the percentage of infections averted
* [Figure 3](figure3_infections_vs_R0.ipynb): Percentage of infections averted as a function of the basic reproduction number
